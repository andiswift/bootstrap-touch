bootstrap-touch
===============

Adds touch &amp; gesture support to your bootstrap components

## The Aim of Bootstrap-Touch
BS-Touch do not change the original BS Library sourcecode. It's a layer for touch interaction and visual improvements, that doesn't work as a standalone framework.
The framework has a *build-in* touch detection and invoke its functionality only on touch or MSPointer enabled devices, like the iPhone or Nokia WindowsPhone.
It's not a part of BS, it's an extension that works hand-in-hand with BS.

## Project State
Currently, I work on a technical concept of such a framework. I'm trying to find an answer, on how this could ne realized.
Last Week, I released a early prototype of one BS component for touch-enabled devices. The project sourcecode is available on [github](https://github.com/ixisio/bootstrap-touch-carousel).

## Next Steps
If you are interested in this project, please help me to find some cool ideas on how to realize somthing like this, [fork](https://github.com/ixisio/bootstrap-touch) the project on github or just have a talk on [twitter](http://twitter.com/ixisio).
In the following list, you can find a few ideas, bugs and improvements I've already collected. Feel free to complete the list..
